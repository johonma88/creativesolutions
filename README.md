Project Details:

This app is a trip planner that uses Google Places & Google Map apis to generate the results based on the User Input. Also, the data inputted by the user will get stored on a dedicated Firebase Database. This data will be used for research purposes and also allow other companies to find out which are the most common destinations. 

Additionally, we have created a fully functional "pseudo" company website to go along with the project. This website includes the usage of multiple .css libraries like animate.css, bootstrap.css, etc. We have also created a company email to reply any comments left to us through our contact us section.

If you feel creative please leave us a comment, and we'll get back to you soon!
